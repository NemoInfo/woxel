\subsection{Comparing DDA, HDDA and HDDA+SDF}

The average milliseconds per frame are compared for the DDA, HDDA and HDDA+SDF algorithms on the teapot model (voxel resolution of $981\times462\times617$) on the ray render mode at three distinct distances from the model, one further away or closer and one near the model. Checking at three separate distances is essential because the performance of the hierarchical algorithms depends on the topology the camera rays are going through. When the target object is far away, most camera rays can traverse the VDB at higher levels in the tree since there is no detail around them. Conversely, when the camera is closer to the object, the rays must traverse more complex topology at lower levels in the tree, and therefore the algorithm can be slower.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|}
    \hline
    & 2000m & 1000m & 500m \\
    \hline

    \hline
    HDDA & 9.4ms & 12.5ms & 14.4ms \\
    \hline

  \label{table:2}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]

As in \cref{rendermods}(b), the colour of pixels is determined based on the steps the ray took to intersect the model. The maximum is 200 steps, which corresponds to bright red.}
  \label{teacomp}
\end{figure}

The DDA version cannot handle a mesh of this resolution since rays are marched one voxel at a time. At 2000 voxels away, no ray can reach the object before it exceeds the maximum step count of 1000. At 500 voxels away, the DDA manages to render part of the teapot at 50 milliseconds per frame ($20$ FPS), which is not enough for modern engines.
Both the HDDA and HDDA+SDF perform very well on this model. The HDDA algorithm has a minimum FPS of 70 at the 500m point. The HDDA+SDF manages to hit the GPU's frame rate cap at 165 FPS at the 2000m point and does not drop below 120 FPS at the close point. Adding the SDF to the HDDA algorithm yields a performance boost of $36\%$ at 2000m, $49\%$ at 1000m, and $47\%$ at 500m.

It is visible in \cref{teacomp} that most of the improvement the SDF offers is for pixels whose corresponding camera rays don't intersect voxels. This is because voxels are intersected relatively quickly in the classic HDDA. The slowest raycasting operations are those that pass voxels very close by and go then off into the background, as shown in \cref{steps}. This is precisely where the SDF is most valuable since it can get the ray out of those high-detail areas faster. Moreover, when the ray travels in low detail space, there is also an improvement because the further the ray gets from the object, the further it will step. This allows rays to get out of bounds much faster.

  \label{steps}
\end{figure}

The same experiment setup is repeated for the ISS model because it has many gaps and tight spaces in its geometry. This time, only HDDA and HDDA+SDF are considered since the DDA could not handle the teapot model, which is much smaller than the ISS. Another change is that the camera positions used are no longer based on the distance to the object but instead positioned such that increasing levels of detail and overlapping geometry are in view.

The colour of pixels is determined analogously to \cref{teacomp}. The efficiency of the SDF method in high-detail areas can be clearly seen by comparing the two images: red patches in the middle of the image get much lighter, and bright red areas exist only very close to the model surface.}
\end{figure}

These two experiments prove the efficiency of the HDDA+SDF method; it gives more than 30 \% speedup over HDDA in all cases and is able to hit the frame rate cap of 165 FPS in most conditions. The high resolution of the test scenes used also proves that HDDA+SDF is a robust ray-marching algorithm that can handle complex scenes with good performance.

\subsection{Performance of HDDA+SDF in ray-tracing}

To test the performance of HDDA+SDF when ray-tracing, the average milliseconds per frame will be recorded in a number of scenes for both diffuse and glossy materials.

\begin{table}[h]

  \caption[Diffuse and glossy renders]{Diffuse (a)-(c) and Glossy (d)-(f) renderings that produce the data int \cref{sdf_test}. (a) and (d) shows the bunny model, (b) and (e) shows the dragon model, (c) and (f) show the ISS model}
\end{figure}

The diffuse rendering scheme performs really well, with a minimum \acrshort{fps} of 150 on the large ISS model and capping out for the other two. The glossy material has a minimum FPS of 71 on the largest model, with each ray being allowed to be reflected twice. This produces reasonably looking glossy materials, but such a small maximum ray reflection count cannot produce photorealistic results. Scaling up the max ray reflection count is infeasible as the number of rays increases exponentially with it, and two is the maximum the engine can handle while staying above 60 FPS.

This shows that the HDDA+SDF performs very well with diffuse materials and dynamic lighting at over 150 FPS and that it is able to accommodate a small amount of reflections off glossy materials, all with around 80 FPS. This means this algorithm is a viable tool for real-time ray tracing.
